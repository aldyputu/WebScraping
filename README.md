# WebScraping
Doing WebScraping learn from scratch

Learn to use python library:
1. requests
2. BeautifulSoup
3. Selenium
4. Scrapy

Doing it for excitement of extracting data from website and learn to restructure it before save it.

Until I can extract data from dynamic content comfortly, I will never stop.

Wish me luck.
